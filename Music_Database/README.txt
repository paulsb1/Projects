A simple program that can be used to keep track of how much music I own
on optical media and how much money I've spent on it. Using some of the 
code from "Sorter" in order to keep the media list sorted alphabetically
prioritizing media type first, then name of band/artist and album. Using
the file media_list.txt containing some random examples for testing. The
prices in this file are arbitrary.
