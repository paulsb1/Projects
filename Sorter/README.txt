A simple program that takes a specified txt file containing a list of words 
as input, sorts all the words in the file alphabetically, and writes them to 
a specified output file. Ignores any duplicate words. 

For testing, I used a file containg the names of all Pokemon in National Dex 
order. The file is called pokemon_names.txt, and the results can be found in
out.txt.
